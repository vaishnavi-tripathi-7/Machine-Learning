### 5. 📊 Statistics
Basic statistics essential for data science:
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Variance and Standard Deviation
- Probability distributions
- Correlation and Covariance

### 6. ⚙️ Feature Engineering

#### 🔹 Standardization
Rescaling data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
- Useful for algorithms that assume normal distribution
- Formula: `z = (x - μ) / σ`

#### 🔹 Normalization
Rescaling data to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].
- Useful for distance-based algorithms
- Formula: `x' = (x - min) / (max - min)`
